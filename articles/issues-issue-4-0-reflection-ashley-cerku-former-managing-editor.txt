Author: No Author Info

Ashley Cerku, Oakland UniversityDear Writing Center Community andTPRReaders,I would like to take this time to thank you for your support of our endeavors of providing work that spotlights emerging writing center researchers, with the ultimate goal of allowing new voices to be heard. I have been involved inTPRsince the very beginning, as I was invited to help brainstorm a new writing center journal that was not only easily accessible online, but also multimodal. Throughout the years, I have had the opportunity to not only see the journal grow, but also see the growth in our entire team of reviewers and editors. As I transitioned into the role of a graduate student reviewer, I quickly realized that we have a lot of untapped talent in the writing center field, and I was excited to be one of the first people to see the research that many were discovering. In January 2017, I became the first Managing Editor ofTPR, which allowed me to become more involved with authors in the initial submission process, as well as help our two new graduate student co-editors move into their new roles. It is through this role that I witnessed how wellTPRis growing the sense of “community”—through bringing people together as a team to both inform the writing center field and inspire future researchers.As the transition into a new executive board continues, I find myself reminiscing about the memories I have made inTPR.I want to thank Dr. Sherry Wynn Perdue for giving me my start inTPR, Kelsey Hixson-Bowles for being an awesome teammate that taught me a lot about the review process, and Dr. Rebecca Hallman Martini for her continued support. I also want to wish the new e-board good luck, especially Karen Moroski-Rigney, the new Managing Editor—you’ll do great. And a sincere thank you again to all of the readers and authors—it has been a great ride.Stay safe and healthy,Ashley CerkuFormer Managing Editor
