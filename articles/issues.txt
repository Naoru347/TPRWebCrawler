We have chosen to focus on two specific methods of a cultural rhetorics approach: story and relationships. The following articles draw from and demonstrate these methods in practice with a focus on how culture and knowledge becomes co-constituted within writing center spaces. We have chosen to arrange this issue in three sections, each with a specific focus. The first section demonstrates the ways in which story and relationships become intertwined within a cultural rhetorics methodological frame work. The second section focuses on the impact stories have in understanding research data and the cultures of specific contexts. The third section focuses on relationships and the value building reciprocating relationships has within writing center spaces. Combined, these sections demonstrate the types of contributions cultural rhetorics can bring to writing center theory and practice.Volume 1Issue 1.2: Special Issue – Writing Centers as Brave/r SpacesFall 2017Issue 1.1Spring 2017In our first peer-reviewed issue of TPR, we have articles that cover wide range of topics and methods including an empirical study about the diversity among writing center directors, an theory and practice piece that analyzes how writing center handbooks shape staff culture, a theoretical piece that engages difference by offering strategies for working with multilingual writers drawn from feminist rhetoric and applied linguistics, an cross-disciplinary, case study about the writing center as multi literacy center, and an empirical/ autobiographical piece written by recent middle school graduates about the value of their writing center work. We also have a book review ofThe Working Lives of New Writing Center Directors.Volume 0Issue 0Fall 2015In this issue, TPR’s first editorial team operationalizes our vision and mission. Instead of offering a bulleted list of submission guidelines, we elected to demonstrate our advice to potential contributors within our own scholarships. We discuss collaborative scholarship, approaches to writing center research (both RAD and qualitative methods), moving from presentation to publication, designing multimodal texts, and understanding reviewer feedback.
