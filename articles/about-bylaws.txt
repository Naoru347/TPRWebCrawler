Title: Policies
Author: No Author Info

BecauseThe Peer Review’sbylaws are stated within IWCA’s bylaws and are fairly broad and unspecific in some cases, theTPRbylaws task force recommends that we create an internal policies and procedures document to help guide, transition, and ground us as an organization. The following policies and procedures are to be voted on by the currentTPRboard and will be adopted if the majority of the quorum accepts them.We fully expect that this document will be updated and amended asTPRcontinues to grow and evolve. When it is time for such changes, the proposed amendments should be drafted and presented to the board for a vote before being implemented.I. MissionRebecca Hallman and Sherry Wynn Perdue outlinedThe Peer Review’s mission in their editor’s introduction of issue zero:“As the founding coeditors ofThe Peer Review, we are privileged to launch a new venue for writing center scholarship: a peer reviewed, open access, fully online, and multimodal journal to showcase the best scholarship of our field. What are the characteristics of this scholarship? When we presented the editorial team with this question, it didn’t take us long to assemble the following descriptors:grounded in theory (or working toward one);framed by the extant literature (when appropriate);supported with data (collected and analyzed by any number of qualitative or quantitative means); andpresented in a medium that best represents the work.While we gave significant attention to what would fill the pages ofTPR, the journal was conceived to engage, to prepare, and to promote the next generation of writing center scholars/researchers. We understand that rigorous scholarship must be intentionally sponsored, soTPRtargets emergent scholars—new professionals, graduate students, undergraduate students, high school writing consultants—and their collaborators. With this publication, we are making a commitment to scaffolding in the form of a two-part review system—the first provided by members of the editorial team and the second conveyed via double blind review—regular works-in-progress sessions, and our inaugural volume, Issue Zero, which anticipates our contributors’ questions and models the scholarship we seek.Our review process, paired internal and external reviews, reflects another component of our mission: to facilitate collaboration. This collaboration is demonstrated in many forms:between novice and experienced scholars;between authors and designers; and/orbetween multilingual and multinational authors.By placing collaboration at the center of this publication, by modeling it in the editorial structure, and by showcasing it in most contributions to Issue Zero, we seek to challenge the primacy of the single author study penned by a scholar who creates art/science in isolation.Yes, we’ve committed to an ambitious undertaking and some (including both editors’ dissertation supervisors) have cautioned us to protect our time, but having studied the field and gotten to know our audience’s potential for knowledge making, we are confident that the pages ofTPRwill be filled with provocative, rigorous scholarship that will further center writing center studies at the heart of academic inquiry.”II. Roles, Job Descriptions, and DutiesThe purpose of this section is to define the different roles available inTPRas well as the descriptions and duties expected of all volunteers.Professional Co-EditorThe professional editor should occupy the role of a writing center professional.The following duties are taken from the IWCA by-laws:“Editorial Duties.

Recruitment, Application, and Selection ProceduresThis section will outline the current process for recruiting, soliciting applications, and evaluating applications for each position. Recruitment, applications, and the selection process should be conducted in a professional, equitable, and methodical manner for all positions.A. Professional Co-EditorRecruitment for the professional editor should begin at least a year to a year and a half before the current professional editor’s term ends. In other words, recruitment should begin half way into the current professional editor’s term. However, a formal call for applications should be made public early in the spring semester prior to the end of the current professional editor’s term.As the IWCA by-laws state: “The IWCA president will appoint the current or a formerTPReditor to form and head a search committee, which will include the Graduate Student Representative as well as members of the editorial team, the IWCA leadership team, etc. as needed.” (Section 2, Subsection B)The application should include the following, though the search committee may choose to ask for more:Cover letter describing why they want the position and what their qualifications areCVThe search committee may also choose to narrow the candidate pool by conducting interviews.Furthermore, the professional editor should be selected in the spring semester in order to shadow the editors as they complete the fall issue.B. Graduate Co-editorsRecruitment for the graduate co-editors should stagger so that there is always an incoming and outgoing editor. Because this position is open every year, recruitment should be a fairly ongoing process. A formal call for applications should be made public early in the spring semester prior to the end of the current out-going graduate co-editor’s term.As the IWCA by-laws state: “The IWCA president will appoint the current or a formerTPReditor to form and head a search committee, which will include the Graduate Student Representative as well as members of the editorial team, the IWCA leadership team, etc. as needed.” (Section 2, Subsection B)The application should include the following, though the search committee may choose to ask for more:Cover letter describing why they want the position and what their qualifications areCVLetter of recommendationThe search committee may also choose to narrow the candidate pool by conducting interviews.Furthermore, the incoming graduate co-editor should be selected in the spring semester in order to shadow the editors as they complete the fall issue.C. Managing EditorDue to the flexibility in the term lengths, recruitment for the managing editor should occur on an as-needed basis.The managing editor will be selected by the co-editors ofTPRand work closely with at least one editor.The application should include the following, though the search committee may choose to ask for more:Cover letter describing why they want the position and what their qualifications areCVLetter of recommendationThe search committee may also choose to narrow the candidate pool by conducting interviews.The incoming managing editor should be selected with enough time for the out-going managing editor to participate in their training before the end of the out-going managing editor’s term.D. Graduate Student ReviewerRecruitment for the graduate student reviewer should occur on an ongoing basis. New GSRs should be selected in early spring.GSRs will be selected by a task force including at least one graduate co-editor, one current GSR, and one professional board member.Applications should include the following:Cover letter describing why they want the position and what their qualifications areCVLetter of recommendationE. Professional Board MemberRecruitment of professional board members should occur on an ongoing basis. New professional board members should be selected in early spring.Professional board members will be selected by a task force including at least the professional editor, one current professional board member, and one current GSR.Applications should include the following:Cover letter describing why they want the position and what their qualifications areCVLetter of recommendationF. External ReviewersRecruitment of external reviewers should occur on an ongoing basis. Editors may add external reviewers at any point in the year, however, invitations to return for another year should occur early in the fall semester.While there is no formal application process for external reviewers, editors should gather the following information about external reviewers:Areas of expertiseDo they currently have students interested in participating in the review process with them?Number of reviews they can commit to in the academic yearIV. Onboarding ProceduresEach new volunteer should be given a copy of this document to help orient them to their role as well as the other positions they will be working with. Furthermore, someone currently in a specific position should provide an orientation meeting for incoming volunteers of that position. This meeting should give them an overview of their new responsibilities as well as give them an opportunity to ask questions about the position and hear from someone who has experienced it first hand.In addition to reminding incoming volunteers ofTPR’s mission, all incoming reviewers should be briefed on the quality standardsTPRstrives for in each publication. Though we don’t expect all submissions to meet those standards immediately, by the time a piece reaches external reviewers, the manuscript should be close enough for a rubric to be appropriate. Therefore, all reviewers should be oriented to the evaluation rubric.Furthermore, there are a few role-specific onboarding procedures that should be followed for each role:A. Co-EditorsBoth the professional and graduate co-editors should spend the fall semester before their terms officially begin shadowing the current editors and learning how an issue is produced.B. Managing EditorThe incoming managing editor should be brought on with enough time in the current managing editor’s term to be trained on the procedures of the position.C. Graduate Student ReviewersGraduate student reviewers should be given an opportunity to practice reviewing an article and given feedback on their reviews prior to reviewing an actual article.Furthermore graduate student reviewers should be paired with a professional board member and/or external reviewer for each article review.D. Professional Board MembersProfessional board members should be oriented to the mentorship expectations ofTPR. They should be given examples of GSR reviews and an opportunity to practice responding to a GSR review in a productive way. Furthermore, professional board members should be presented with options for guiding the GSR through the review process.E. External ReviewersExternal reviewers should be oriented to the mentorship expectations ofTPR. They should be given examples of student reviews and an opportunity to practice responding to a student review in a productive way. Furthermore, external reviewers should be presented with options for guiding students through the review process.V. Mentorship and Review ProcessThe Peer Review’s review process is unique in that it also seeks to mentor students on the inner workings of academic publishing. Both the internal and external reviews should incorporate mentorship when possible. The following describes the double blind mentorship and review process:Author submits manuscriptManaging editor sends confirmation to author (within 1-2 business days)Managing editor sends manuscript to editors (within 1-2 business days)Editors read manuscript and decide if it goes on to internal reviewers (one month)Internal reviewers are identified based on strengths, specialities, and availability. (Note: editors should limit the number of times an internal reviewer in called upon)Editors notify internal reviewers that a manuscript is ready for them to reviewInternal reviewers read and respond (8 weeks)Internal professional board members and graduate student reviewers touch base to establish their preferred method of mentorship and reviewingIn order to maintain both reviewers’ perspectives, we recommend that professional board members and graduate student reviewers read and respond separatelyProfessional board member and graduate student reviewer have a conversation about how to review appropriately (may be dependent on where the GSR is in their development as a reviewer)Reviewers send their reviews to the editorsEditors compile reviews and send to author(s). Author(s) should be given our “Working with and Managing Reviewer Feedback.” (2-3 business days)Professional board members may choose to reveal their identities to the authors and invite authors to contact them directly if they have questionsGSRs should remain anonymousAuthor(s) are given 4-6 weeks to revise and resubmit.Editors offer to meet with author(s) during this revision time to talk through revisions.Author(s) resubmitEditors read through again and decide if it’s ready to go to external reviewers (one month)If not, editors can choose to send it back to original internal reviewers or respond themselves depending on the level of revision they think is neededIf so, editors identify external reviewers, send them the manuscript, the rubric, a deadline, and a gentle reminder about mentorship opportunities.External reviewers respond (8 weeks)If mentorship opportunities are available with a student at their institution, then external reviewers should feel free to include them in the process.We can also pair a GSR with an external reviewerEditors compile reviews and send to author(s) (2-3 business days)Author(s) choose to revise4-6 weeks to reviseCan meet with an editor again to talk through revisionsAuthor(s) resubmits final draftVI. Special Issue ProceduresBoard members may choose to propose a special issue. Topics for special issues should be as kairotic as possible and offer a publication opportunity not currently available among the other journals in the field.Editors should also strive to balance the number of special issues with general submission issues in a year so as to best provide adequate publication opportunities to emerging scholars.To propose a special issue, a board member should propose a CFP and timeline to the co-editors. Co-editors should then review the CFP and timeline individually before meeting to discuss:Is this an appropriate topic for a special issue?Is this an appropriate time for this topic and/or for a special issue?If yes to both, what revisions/suggestions do you have for the special issues editors?To ensure that the special issue publication process runs smoothly, a current co-editor should serve as one of the special issue co-editors. Non-board members may serve as a special issue co-editor as well.Editors of special issues should update TPR editors on a regular basis about the status of the issue.
