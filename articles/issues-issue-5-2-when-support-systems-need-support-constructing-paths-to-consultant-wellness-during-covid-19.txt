It situates the consultants’ reflections among current literature on consultant mental health and wellness and suggests we “fill the gap” in this literature by continuing research on consultants’ well-being. Consultants reflect on a specific intervention assignment they engaged with in an ongoing consultant education course at a small liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest during Fall 2020: the Pandemic Wellness Project. They conclude that writing centers should: offer more opportunities for processing cognitive load; make space for consultant mental health and wellness as a regular—andsignificant—part of consultant education theory and practice; and create new avenues for meaningful dialogue between consultant and director, consultant and consultant, and, especially, consultant and self.Keywords:COVID-19, pandemic, mental health, wellness, cognitive load, well-being, lived experiences, mindfulness, intentionality, motivation, self-care, assignment design, online consulting, communication, support systems, development, ongoing education, Pandemic Wellness Project, reflection, emotion, body language, tutoring style, learning style, survival, grace, community, social justice, helping, vulnerability, safety protocol, relationships, space, place, modal expression, consulting roles, empathyWCC Coffee Mug.

While consulting during thepandemic has provided these student workers with0:00:32.400,0:00:37.040meaningful work and relationship opportunities,it has also revealed the negative impacts of0:00:37.040,0:00:41.120increased cognitive load on both theirquality of work and personal well-being.0:00:41.920,0:00:47.360In this video essay, we offer the lived experiencesof consultants at a small, liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest0:00:47.360,0:00:52.080as testimony for writingcenter scholars’ further attention to writing0:00:52.080,0:00:57.840center practices that productively focuson consultants’ mental health and wellness.Transition to scholarly contextOn-screen, video:Shot personal interview style with two undergraduate consultants (Aivaliotis and Pierson) talking directly into camera; important concepts occasionally highlighted in white text on the screen, verbatim0:00:59.680,0:01:04.960Aivaliotis:So, the research for mindfulness in the writingcenter has been increasing over the past, kind of,0:01:04.960,0:01:12.080five to seven years, and one great example of thisis a study done by Elizabeth Mack and Katie Hupp.0:01:12.080,0:01:17.600They published “Mindfulness in the WritingCenter: A Total Encounter,” which is a0:01:17.600,0:01:23.200publication that describes an eight-week-longexperiment that the director, Katie Hupp, did.0:01:24.640,0:01:30.400In this experiment, she let people,or her consultants, voluntarily0:01:31.040,0:01:36.400decide if they wanted to participate in this,in this eight-week long program, where each week0:01:36.400,0:01:42.800they would have a new mindfulness exercise thatthey would do either at work or outside of work.0:01:44.320,0:01:49.360For example, they would take some time. Theywould, like, outside of work, they would take0:01:49.360,0:01:54.320five minutes to just breathe and becomemore aware of their surroundings each day.0:01:55.200,0:02:03.040And another example of, like, the during worktime is that they would take an extra minute0:02:03.040,0:02:10.240or two in between consultations to just, kind of,center themselves again, themselves again, and0:02:10.240,0:02:15.920be able to approach the next consultation with anopen mind and not carry over any negativity from0:02:15.920,0:02:25.440the past ones if it happens to be negative. AndElizabeth Mack wrote about her positive experience0:02:25.440,0:02:32.080in this experiment. She’s one of the consultants.And she said some of the biggest things that stood0:02:32.080,0:02:39.920out to her were that they really appreciatedthe intentionality behind the mindfulness that,0:02:40.560,0:02:49.440that Katie was trying to create. The studentsreported that they found it particularly helpful0:02:49.440,0:02:54.880to take the frequent breaks, and just breathe, andthat becoming more conscious of their surroundings0:02:54.880,0:03:00.720helped them be able to focus better. Oneof the biggest takeaways was also that they0:03:01.360,0:03:06.720were focused on listening rather than reacting,which is very helpful in consultations, especially0:03:07.520,0:03:14.960if the client and the consultant aren’thaving the greatest time. And these0:03:14.960,0:03:20.960practices improved motivation and kept energylevels higher, which is very positive as well.0:03:21.680,0:03:27.280Some exercises, however, were more beneficial thanothers, and it was kind of challenging for them to0:03:28.320,0:03:33.360keep mindfulness present in their minds when inthe room with a client, because sometimes it’s just0:03:33.360,0:03:41.760harder to put those things into actions. And it’salso hard to actually make time for just taking0:03:41.760,0:03:48.320care of yourself, as I think we all know. Andthose, yeah, those were some of the challenges that0:03:48.320,0:03:55.120they found during the study.Pierson: Another article thatwe found super helpful to, kind of, contextualizing0:03:55.120,0:04:02.800our own scholarship in this area of mindfulnessand wellness in the writing center is an article0:04:02.800,0:04:09.280from Sarah Johnson called “Mindful Tutors, EmbodiedWriters: Positioning Mindfulness Meditation0:04:09.840,0:04:15.120as a Writing Strategy to Optimize Cognitive Loadand Potentialize Writing Center Tutor Supporting0:04:15.120,0:04:25.200Roles.” So that’s quite the mouthful, but really whatthis article is saying is that there is a lot0:04:25.200,0:04:33.600of cognitive load that goes on in the process oflearning, which—wow, huge surprise statement—, but0:04:33.600,0:04:41.280Sarah Johnson really helpfully delineates herebetween germane cognitive load, which is cognitive0:04:41.280,0:04:49.680load that is actually necessary and needed inorder for the learner to absorb, to learn—to absorb0:04:49.680,0:04:58.080information and to learn. Or, on the other hand,there’s extraneous cognitive load, and that’s0:04:58.080,0:05:05.920just cognitive load that exists because of theway the assignment is structured or because of the0:05:05.920,0:05:13.120fact that we’re in a, we’re learning in a pandemicright now, right? But it doesn’t have anything to do0:05:13.120,0:05:18.560with the actual content of the material, right,with the actual material that’s being learned.0:05:19.440,0:05:27.840And, so, Johnson argues that mindfulnessis one way to reduce this cognitive load.0:05:28.480,0:05:35.200She also advocates for better assignment designand for an increased awareness that advocates0:05:35.760,0:05:44.160can, that directors and consultants, are awareof the cognitive load they place on their clients.0:05:44.160,0:05:49.280So, that, we find this article super helpfulbecause we find this idea of cognitive load0:05:49.280,0:05:56.720to be a very helpful way to think about a pandemic,right? In a pandemic, suddenly there is a lot more0:05:56.720,0:06:04.320extraneous cognitive load, even if you’recompletely online and safe at an institution, which0:06:04.320,0:06:11.440our institution is not; we, we have a hybrid modelgoing on. You’re still thinking about all these0:06:12.320,0:06:17.360complicated interactions with technology insteadof just sitting down in a classroom.Aivaliotis: Through this0:06:17.360,0:06:26.960research, we identified a few things where werealized that our own writing center might0:06:26.960,0:06:32.960fall short and just kind of writing centers ingeneral. We realized that we need more documented0:06:32.960,0:06:39.280experiences of tutor wellnesses during a pandemicin order to accurately grasp where the gaps are.0:06:40.480,0:06:45.680We also need stronger paths formalized ofcommunication between our director and0:06:45.680,0:06:51.120consultants in the online world since now you [don’t]have random run-ins happen at the library or0:06:51.120,0:06:57.600coffee shop or just anywhere on campus. And weneed more in/formal support and development as well.0:06:58.240,0:07:05.760So, figuring out how to maintain these practicesin an online setting, even though now we don’t0:07:05.760,0:07:13.200have them—or we don’t have access to such supportas much anymore. And, so, we need to find new ways0:07:13.200,0:07:29.840where we can establish a more informal settingthat helps us take care of our minds and mental health.Transition to assignment introductionOn-screen, text: The Intervention: The Pandemic Wellness ProjectOn-screen, video: Clements [writing center director] narrates over stills and video: images of writing center, classroom space, pandemic-related signage, and the assignment prompt itself.0:07:31.200,0:07:34.960Clements: It’s unsettling, like rememberingwhere I was on September 11th.0:07:37.840,0:07:41.440But I do remember exactly where I was when I got0:07:41.440,0:07:46.160the email stating there would beno going back after spring break.0:07:50.400,0:07:55.600I was with my consultants facilitatingour ongoing education practicum0:07:55.600,0:08:00.800in a library computer lab just down the hallfrom our writing center’s physical location.0:08:03.680,0:08:12.720There was a nervous energy that intensified afterI made the announcement to the class. We didn’t0:08:12.720,0:08:21.040know what that email really meant. But theinstitution birthed a flex approach over0:08:21.040,0:08:26.560the summer, and I knew I would need to addressnot only the modal changes with my consultants0:08:27.200,0:08:34.720but also, how a world turned upside downimpacted their mental and emotional0:08:34.720,0:08:42.880well-being. So, I implemented the “PandemicWellness Project.” It’s a reflective project,0:08:44.240,0:08:51.280a chance for consultants to process the cognitiveload of the pandemic, because, as I mentioned in the0:08:51.280,0:08:57.920prompt, the pandemic context will bring unusualcircumstances to bear on your consulting work.0:08:59.280,0:09:03.600This individual reflection helped usbetter understand the gap in writing0:09:03.600,0:09:08.000center literature surrounding consultantmental health and wellness, but we know we0:09:08.000,0:09:14.160could do more. So, we decided to collaborativelyreflect as we entered the scholarly conversation,0:09:14.160,0:09:21.840to further interrogate what we learnedand what we can do with what we learned.Transition to collaborative undergrad tutor reflections, parts 1, 2, and 3.Part 1On-screen, video: Shot group interview style in Zoom during an undergraduate consultant continuing education class session; some close-up “speaker” views and some class as a whole, “group grid” views.On-screen, text: How has the pandemic affected you as a consultant?0:09:28.960,0:09:34.320Kramer: So, I still meet with students face-to-facewith a plexiglass screen and everything. And, so,0:09:34.320,0:09:38.400it’s definitely been nice to be able to dothat, but, at the same time, you’re missing0:09:38.400,0:09:42.400some of that emotional connection that you mighthave had otherwise just being able to see facial0:09:42.400,0:09:48.880expressions and everything. And, so, though youcan tell that the clients and I really enjoy0:09:48.880,0:09:53.040that, it definitely makes it harder to connectand sometimes embrace that vulnerability that0:09:53.040,0:10:00.480comes with sharing your writing.Lochridge: And it alsomeans I have to adjust my tutoring style—as0:10:00.480,0:10:05.760well as the client might have to adjust theirlearning style—to be able to fit into whatever,0:10:07.680,0:10:10.880whatever we can get through on theonline platform that we’re using.0:10:11.440,0:10:16.480Muñoz Laserreta: As a Spanish [language writing] consultant it’s just harder for meto explain the language when we’re missing body0:10:16.480,0:10:22.080language, like you were saying, and face-to-faceinteraction is just, like, makes it harder.0:10:22.640,0:10:28.000Students are also way less motivated to makeappointments.Pierson: When students are, kind of, in0:10:28.000,0:10:33.440this survival mode of, like, “we’re online—we just got to get through this semester,0:10:34.080,0:10:37.520gotta get through this pandemic—” itbecomes a lot harder to talk about0:10:37.520,0:10:45.840things like forming a better writer and, like,pushing yourself off towards writing excellence.0:10:48.400,0:10:58.480And, so, to some degree there’s this tensionof, like, how much do you ask the client0:10:58.480,0:11:04.400to get, to develop, and how much do you say, “okaywell, we are in a pandemic, there needs to be some grace here.”On-screen, text: How has the pandemic affected you as a student?0:11:10.960,0:11:15.760Shuhda: I will say that does come with some benefits ofknowing and having the security to know that I’m0:11:15.760,0:11:24.400safe from, you know, the pandemic, by sitting onthe other side of a screen, but, at the same time,0:11:24.400,0:11:28.480missing those environmental, thosetactile, sensations as a student0:11:28.480,0:11:35.520really does not do well for the academic mind.Pierson: I think the pandemic really has increased the0:11:35.520,0:11:42.000cognitive load of taking classes, and, so,suddenly, there’s just a difficulty—0:11:43.040,0:11:47.920like, you can’t just go to class, attend alecture. Even if you’re going to class in-person,0:11:47.920,0:11:50.960you still need to, like, pay attentionto safety and health protocols.0:11:50.960,0:11:55.840Those things are things that you have to thinkabout, but they’re not actually helping you learn.On-screen, text: How has the pandemic affect you as a person?0:12:02.800,0:12:08.800Lochridge: I just feel a lot more isolated, justin general, throughout my, my work as0:12:08.800,0:12:13.520a student and as a consultant. It’s really,just, kind of reduced a lot of my schoolwork,0:12:13.520,0:12:18.720a lot of my time in school, to just doingschoolwork and not really anything besides that.0:12:18.720,0:12:24.560Aivaliotis: I’m very much an extrovert, and I love just hangingout with people, doing work around people, and,0:12:25.680,0:12:31.840just, those connections are kind of what keep megoing. And just spending so much time online0:12:31.840,0:12:38.640is very draining, and my energy level has beenprobably the lowest that it ever has been in0:12:38.640,0:12:44.000this past year.Muñoz Laserreta: It’s hard just knowing that, for example,my grandma has been by herself for months now,0:12:44.000,0:12:49.120or that my mom who’s a nurse is working overtimebecause some of her co-workers contracted COVID,0:12:50.000,0:12:56.720and something I’ve also struggled a lot with is,just, I don’t know, I guess realizing how unfair0:12:56.720,0:13:00.880the world is in general, like howpeople don’t want to wear a mask,0:13:00.880,0:13:07.840how minorities have been deeply affected by thispandemic, how the US will be fully vaccinated0:13:07.840,0:13:12.480soon but third-world countries will not geta single vaccine.Shuhda: As someone who suffers from0:13:13.040,0:13:22.240anxiety, depression, and I also, I have ADHD,it has been, it has been a real struggle.On-screen, text: How has your writing center work complicated or supported you during the pandemic?0:13:28.960,0:13:33.920Muñoz Laserreta: The few consultations that I [have] had during thepandemic were absolutely wonderful, like, they0:13:33.920,0:13:38.960were a way of socializing and feeling, like, thesense of community that I feel, like, we all need.0:13:39.600,0:13:45.280And once I was done with the consultations, it justfelt great knowing that you’re helping someone0:13:45.280,0:13:49.440even though it’s just with a paper orwhatever project they’re working on.0:13:49.440,0:13:54.880It’s just, like, made me happy to know I could makesomeone’s life a little easier during a pandemic.0:13:55.520,0:14:00.000Kapus: So, like, the social justice issues and all theseother things, kind of, all happening at once—and it0:14:00.000,0:14:07.440can feel really overwhelming to, just, have so muchto worry about. Having this time where I can help0:14:07.440,0:14:14.080students and, just, completely focus on them andmake a small—but I think meaningful—contribution0:14:14.080,0:14:20.240to the Whitworth community is, has been a reallypositive and affirming thing.Pierson: When I have clients,0:14:20.800,0:14:27.120and I’m able to work with them, that is a verysatisfying and honestly, like, life-giving thing,0:14:27.120,0:14:33.040because it’s just very straightforward, like, it’sa very straightforward way of, just, helping someone0:14:33.600,0:14:39.600in a very simple way—but it’s at least it’ssomething that I can do.Shuhda: I want to give my 100 percent,0:14:39.600,0:14:46.080but I just don’t have enough energy to be able togive that to . . . my job in the writing center,0:14:47.680,0:14:52.720and that can be distressing, but it’s one of thereasons why we’ve been doing this project, is to0:14:52.720,0:15:01.280provide information and context and research firsthandabout the support we can offer for each other0:15:01.280,0:15:16.160in a pandemic as writing center employees.Part 2On-screen, video: Shot personal interview style by individual undergraduate consultants in their own homes/dorms or offices/campus common spaces.On-screen, text: What is an area of relationship building thatsufferedhas or improved during the pandemic in the process of consultations?Lochridge: Workingas a writing consultant during the pandemic has0:15:16.160,0:15:22.320actually provided me opportunities to buildrelationships in ways that I wouldn’t have0:15:23.040,0:15:27.760during the pandemic without this job. These arerelationships and opportunities that I wouldn’t0:15:27.760,0:15:33.360have had without my work in the writingcenter regardless of the pandemic or not.0:15:34.640,0:15:39.840Because I’ve taken all of my appointmentsand all of my team meetings this year online,0:15:40.720,0:15:43.920most of these relationships that I havewith people through the writing center0:15:44.720,0:15:50.400have never been face-to-face, and it’s especiallydifficult without, you know, face-to-face connection0:15:50.400,0:15:55.920and some physical proximity to be ableto facilitate a growth of relationship.0:15:55.920,0:16:01.600Guttridge: Consulting in a pandemic is strange. Even asan in-person consultant, I would estimate that0:16:01.600,0:16:07.840around half of my appointments are still onlineeither because I’m in isolation or my client is0:16:07.840,0:16:14.400in isolation or there’s some kind of confusionaround in-person versus virtual consultations0:16:14.400,0:16:20.400and who the right consultant to sign up with wouldbe.Kramer: Honestly, things have been very hard for a lot0:16:20.400,0:16:27.440of people during this pandemic. As most people,everybody knows, like, relationships have suffered,0:16:27.440,0:16:32.640mental health has suffered, and things havebeen really difficult. And, so, when I ask someone,0:16:33.200,0:16:38.800“How’s your day going? How are you?” a lot of timesI’ll get more of an honest answer now than I might0:16:38.800,0:16:44.240have before the pandemic. And I am an in-personcon—, consultant, so I do have the, kind of, that0:16:44.880,0:16:49.360benefit of being able to talk them in-person,but . . . .Pierson: Even though there’s been moments of real0:16:49.360,0:16:58.000vulnerability with clients, the screen has madethat impossible to, to turn that into relationship.0:16:58.000,0:17:04.080Aivaliotis: In an online format, it’s just hard, because there’snot much structure, and, so, because everything just0:17:04.080,0:17:12.640happens through a screen, and, so, it’s just, kindof, it’s harder to keep track and stay focused.Shuhda: I0:17:13.520,0:17:18.080sincerely wish that we could feel a littlebit more rooted in the community because0:17:18.080,0:17:25.360it’s no longer a case of being able to sit in ouroffice and wave “hi!” to people as they come by, which,0:17:26.400,0:17:31.840though it’s a small thing, definitelygenerates a sense of “we’re here for you.”0:17:34.240,0:17:37.600Kapus: I think one more aspect of relationship buildingthat has been a little bit difficult since the0:17:37.600,0:17:43.840pandemic is checking in with a client at thebeginning of the appointment, because when I ask0:17:43.840,0:17:48.320how they’re doing the answer is, of course, thatthey’re not doing well because this is a pandemic0:17:48.320,0:17:55.120and everyone is struggling. So how much of my timedo I spend checking in with them emotionally, and0:17:55.120,0:18:00.880how much of the time do I say we should, you know,work academically and be respectful of your time0:18:01.760,0:18:14.960for, to work on the thing that you made theappointment to work on?On-screen, text: How has the pandemic affected your relationships with your fellow consultants?Kramer: Before COVID, we would0:18:14.960,0:18:21.760have a lot of overlapping shifts, and we’d beable to, kind of, come together in that writing0:18:21.760,0:18:28.480center space and talk about like, “Oh, shoot, like,how do you do this one thing of APA citation?”0:18:28.480,0:18:33.600or “How’s your day going?” and, just, like, kindof, connect in those ways, and that’s just not0:18:33.600,0:18:39.280a thing anymore. If, sometimes I’ll see theother fellow in-person consultant. We have, like,0:18:39.280,0:18:44.640half an hour of an overlapping shift, but, I mean,there’s a plastic screen between us. There’s all0:18:44.640,0:18:48.320the COVID precautions, which is fantasticand great and I’m glad we have those, but0:18:48.320,0:18:54.400it’s just not the same environment that it wasbefore and not the same community, honestly.0:18:55.440,0:18:59.840And, so, I feel, like, although I’ve stillbeen able to foster those relationships0:18:59.840,0:19:07.680between consultants that were already there,I do think that the newer consultants and I0:19:07.680,0:19:13.360haven’t been able to connect in that way.Pierson: I’llbe honest, the primary way I built relationships0:19:14.000,0:19:20.960with my fellow consultants was by justsharing space, sharing the space of the center0:19:20.960,0:19:30.960with them. And, so, when that was lost, a lot of myopportunity to build relationships have come, [to]0:19:30.960,0:19:34.400have conversations, just completelycollapsed.Shuhda: I genuinely miss being able0:19:34.400,0:19:39.920to work alongside my consultants in workshopsor to share hours together in our writing center.0:19:40.880,0:19:46.480A lot of it just has to do with spending time with thepeople you work with and then founding positive0:19:46.480,0:19:51.200and influential professional relationships fromthat time spent with each other.Lochridge: Working during0:19:51.200,0:19:56.000the pandemic has, of course, caused some strainon those relationships, and it’s made it kind of0:19:56.000,0:20:02.480difficult to progress and deepen those bonds bothwith clients and my fellow consultants in kind of0:20:02.480,0:20:08.960similar ways.Aivaliotis: This is my first year consulting, andI am fully online. And, so, it’s been, I’ve just felt0:20:08.960,0:20:14.320a little disconnected from the center itself. Like,our weekly meetings for EL-421, those are helpful0:20:14.320,0:20:21.280in like connecting us, but they’re all usually justvery, like, project-focused and stuff like that.Kapus: I do0:20:21.280,0:20:26.000feel a little bit closer to my fellow consultantsnow than I did before the pandemic, and this is0:20:26.000,0:20:31.120because we have been so open and honest witheach other about our struggles with school,0:20:31.120,0:20:35.760our struggles with the pandemic, our struggles withmental health and all of the things that we’ve0:20:35.760,0:20:41.440experienced over this last year. Through thisproject, and, just, through talks through our class, I0:20:41.440,0:20:47.840think that this vulnerability that we’ve reallyshared with each other has brought us all closer.On-screen, text: How has the pandemic affected your relationships with your clients?0:20:54.400,0:21:00.880Kapus: Besides the fact that it is more difficult to readnonverbal cues over a screen and besides the fact0:21:00.880,0:21:06.320that everyone is struggling more than they dida year ago, I do think that my relationships with0:21:06.320,0:21:13.440clients have still continued to be really positiveones.Guttridge: I think there’s also this greater gratitude0:21:13.440,0:21:20.000that I experience and am able to express—to beable to meet with them and see them. And I think, in0:21:20.000,0:21:24.960that sense, the pandemic has made relationshipbuilding with clients a lot more personal,0:21:24.960,0:21:32.160because we already share this understanding of oneanother’s stress in and outside of academics, and0:21:32.160,0:21:38.960there’s this heightened awareness of the emotionaland mental needs that a client and a consultant0:21:38.960,0:21:44.160has rather than solely, like, writing needs orwriting knowledge.Pierson: It feels like my intuition0:21:45.360,0:21:55.280is, is less specific and direct. It feels likewe have less conversations that, that build toward,0:21:55.840,0:22:00.720kind of, like, big issues in writing. [It] feels morelike we’re just doing the bare minimum.Shuhda: I have0:22:00.720,0:22:07.920hopes that things may change, but I can’t relyupon that at the present time, and it’s unfortunate,0:22:07.920,0:22:13.600because I know all my clients are in the sameboat with me.Aivaliotis: I’ve had a few clients who0:22:14.240,0:22:22.240come back a, like, bunch of times, and, so, I, kind of,begin forming some kind of, or at least building a,0:22:22.240,0:22:28.240rapport with them, which has been really nice. Andit’s also just really nice that you know people0:22:28.240,0:22:32.640want to come back to me because they appreciatedmy help in the first place and stuff like that. But0:22:32.640,0:22:41.200it’s a lot harder to become friends with someonewhen all you know is online.Kramer: People have definitely0:22:41.920,0:22:45.920had to face their emotions a little bit moreduring this time because things have been0:22:45.920,0:22:52.240so difficult. And, in some ways, that has beenbeneficial for building relationships, opening up0:22:52.240,0:22:58.320and, kind of, getting into that vulnerabilityaspect. Being able to open up with clients who0:22:58.320,0:23:04.080maybe have been really struggling throughoutthe pandemic, who come in and this is one of their0:23:04.080,0:23:08.960in-center interactions, is one of theironly in-person interactions throughout0:23:08.960,0:23:14.080the day just because a lot of classes arein Zoom, that’s been actually beneficial0:23:14.080,0:23:21.840for my relationships with clients as I am anin-center, in-person consultant during this time.Part 3On-screen, video: Voiceover still and/or animated original stick-figure comic/cartoon-style images composed by undergraduate consultants meant to represent how their training felt, in general, disconnected from their human experiences of consulting in the pandemic.On-screen, text: How did pre-pandemic training prepare/fail you for the transition to full-time consulting?0:23:28.160,0:23:34.240Lochridge: I was trained as a writing consultant during thespring of 2020, and, so, the focus of my training0:23:34.240,0:23:38.720was primarily one-on-one, in-person tutoring.And then in the middle of the term, COVID0:23:38.720,0:23:44.240hits, and campus closed, and classes went online.This year, though, I am working entirely online.0:23:45.840,0:23:52.400And, so, of course my role is the same, but how I goabout fulfilling that role on a day-to-day basis0:23:53.920,0:23:58.560with clients one-on-one, that’svery different than what I was0:23:58.560,0:24:01.760trained for, and it’s something that I’ve,kind of, had to figure out as I go along.0:24:02.880,0:24:10.640Shuhda: In some respects, writing center training has failedus in the pandemic, and I feel, notably, it’s the0:24:11.200,0:24:18.160ability to develop and cultivate empatheticrelationships. We were able to show that we0:24:18.160,0:24:25.120cared about them as students. We cared about themas people. What hurts so much through the pandemic0:24:26.000,0:24:33.360is we don’t know how to do that through a screen.We can’t really show the same level of concern0:24:34.800,0:24:44.560for their wellbeing and for their happiness. We’reboth stuck on opposite sides of a wi-fi network.Guttridge: As0:24:44.560,0:24:50.720I’ve gotten more experience and more practicein, I’ve been able to come to trust the training0:24:50.720,0:24:56.080that I did receive. A lot more of our class timewas used to check in on one another, and, together,0:24:56.080,0:25:01.440we could acknowledge how we were struggling. Itwas this shared experience, and I think that set0:25:01.440,0:25:08.800a tone of anticipating a lot of trial. I do thinkit was really helpful to have this sense that0:25:08.800,0:25:15.920our WCC [Whitworth Composition Commons] center is really supportive of whatconsultants need as I began my time in the WCC.On-screen, text: How have your skills improved or degraded in the pandemic?0:25:22.240,0:25:28.480Pierson: Since the pandemic has begun, I’vegrown to be a lot more concerned about0:25:29.120,0:25:36.640directly helping the writer and what the writer isworking on right there in the moment. So, what that0:25:36.640,0:25:43.120means in practice is I’m a lot more directive,because I feel like clients won’t listen to me0:25:43.120,0:25:50.080unless I’m providing material help. There is somuch crisis all around them, even a low-level0:25:50.080,0:25:57.120crisis, that it requires I be just a little moreproactive in how I consult.Aivaliotis: It has also been fun0:25:57.920,0:26:07.360because I got to learn a lot about myself andhow to teach others even when I don’t feel0:26:07.920,0:26:13.200super great. It has been really nice to still beable to consult even though I’m home right now,0:26:14.240,0:26:21.280because it gives me the opportunity to stillconnect with Whitworth students in a different way.Kramer: I’ve0:26:21.280,0:26:26.800just realized the importance of that nonverbalcommunication, because me, like, moving my hands and0:26:26.800,0:26:33.520stuff, and waving that around, and to be like “Wow!this is so good!” or to use my eyebrows and, like,0:26:33.520,0:26:39.840light up and surprise, like, that means so much more.Being in the writing center during COVID, and that0:26:39.840,0:26:45.920whole process, has taught me to really work on myinterpersonal skills, to structure it to the client,0:26:45.920,0:26:52.160to what they need, and serve them to the best of myability, whether that means adapting or whatnot0:26:52.160,0:26:58.480even throughout the consultation.Transition to conclusion.On-screen, video: Undergraduate consultants speak individual lines directly into the camera. All shots directly against a dark blue/back background.Lochridge: Consultants arecaregivers.Pierson: While consulting is both satisfying0:26:59.040,0:27:07.360Aivaliotis: and life-giving,Kapus: even and especially duringa pandemic,Kramer: we can’t pour from an empty cup.0:27:09.040,0:27:19.840Aivaliotis: The COVID-19 pandemic will end,Shuhda: but there willbe other traumas,Lochridge: both collectiveKapus: and personal.0:27:22.080,0:27:26.560Pierson: Help us reduce cognitive load,Kramer: by filling the wellness gap.0:27:29.040,0:27:33.840Shuhda: Fill the gap.On-screen, text: Continue this researchOn-screen, text: RAD methodologies do not eschew leaning into empirical methods and listening carefully to the lived experiences of consultants.0:27:46.960,0:27:47.840Lochridge: Fill the gap.On-screen, text: Offer opportunities for processing cognitive load.On-screen, text [appearing one line at a time]: We can’t always reduce cognitive load (make pressures disappear), but we can help consultants process cognitive load by explicitly recognizing and responding to their mental health and wellness concerns through exercises like the Pandemic Wellness Project.0:28:32.640,0:28:43.840Pierson: Fill the gap.On-screen, text: Make space for consultant mental health and wellness as a regular—andsignificant—part of consultant education theory and practice.On-screen, text: Humanizing the consultant experience should have as much or more emphasis as professionalizing the consultant experience.On-screen, text: Create a dialogue between consultant and director: Include mental health reflection as part of daily job duties if educational coursework, staff meeting time, or online modules are not amenable.On-screen, text: Create a dialogue between consultant and consultant: Organize peer mentorship for ongoing mental health and wellness discussion as well as social bonding occasions that create goodwill among the consultants as a staff.On-screen, text: Create a dialogue between consultant and self: introduce practices that celebrate the accomplishments and important events in the life of consultants; let them know it’s not only their effectiveness with clients that matter, but alsotheirwellbeing.0:29:46.560,0:29:47.520Kramer: Fill the gap.0:29:50.080,0:29:53.840Clements: By filling the cup.0:30:42.400,0:30:42.900On-screen, text: Works Cited and Consulted[Each entry shows up as text on an individual screen for approximately 7 seconds]Dixon, Elise, and Rachel Robinson, editors.Special Issue: (Re)Defining Welcome.
