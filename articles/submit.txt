OverviewThe Peer Review is an open-access, multimodal journal intended to showcase the work of graduate, undergraduate, and secondary education tutors engaged in writing center research. Although we accept work from more established writing center scholars, we are especially interested in submissions from new voices in writing center studies. We also welcome co-authored pieces and those that engage image, sound, and video in less traditional formats. Our Editorial Team is committed to mentorship and we welcome any queries. If you are interested in editing a Special Issue, please see our Guidelines for Special Issue Proposal.Please contact us at editorstpr@gmail.com with any questions.Submit to TPRConversation ShapersTPR is currently accepting submission for a new publication type: Conversation Shapers. Conversation Shapers are projects that work to shape future writing center research. Conversation Shapers include a curated bibliography on a single, focused writing center topic such as but not limited to: Linguistic Justice in the Writing Center, Social Justice in Online Centers, Anti-Racist Tutoring Training, Accessibility in the Center, Tutor Labor Conditions, Director Labor Conditions. Conversation Shapers should have an overarching equity and inclusive theme to them and amplify scholarship authored by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). A Conversation Shaper submission should include a 500-word framing statement that introduces the topic, its connection to equity and inclusion, and summarizes the bibliography. Following the framing statement, the bibliography should be formatted in APA and include 20-25 sources. While sources can be from related fields of study, at least half of the sources should be writing center scholarship. Following the bibliography should be a “where we’d like the field to go” section. In this field shaping section, authors should offer research questions or scholarship that they’d like to read. Preference will be given to undergraduate and graduate tutors to author reading lists. If professionals are interested in submitting a Conversation Shaper, we encourage you to collaborate with a tutor.If interested in authoring a Conversation Shaper, please submit a one-paragraph proposal to the TRP Editorial Team that details your theme. The TRP Editorial team will review all proposals. Accepted proposals will be assigned to a TPR Editorial Team Member who will mentor the author through the curation of their submission and then send the list out for review.Conversation Shapers will be published with General Issues and may be published ahead of print when Special Issues are being published.Submit Conversation ShaperDeadlinesThe Peer Review publishes at least two issues per year: Spring and Fall.

Special issues deal with timely topics of broad interest that have yet to receive full attention in writing center studies. They should also attract high quality articles from writing center scholars and practitioners of all standings and institutional backgrounds, with extra attention to writers’ whose voices have not been widely published.In order to ensure both timeliness and quality, potential guest editors should send queries for special issues to the TPR editors at editorstpr@gmail.com. Once the idea has been accepted as viable for TPR, the special issue editors will construct a CFP that must ultimately receive approval by the TPR Editorial Board. Working closely with at least one TPR Editor, the special issue editors will detail a timeline and projected release date for the issue.CFPs should include:TitleContextualized introduction that locates the special issue’s exigenceList of questions or possible topicsList of any special features or article typesA tentative timelineAfter approval by the Editorial Board, TPR Special Issue editors will exercise editorial freedom and management for their issue (except in extenuating circumstances), consulting with the TPR editor on an as needed basis.
