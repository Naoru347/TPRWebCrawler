The Peer Review is a fully online, open-access, multimodal scholarly journal that promotes the work of emerging writing center researchers. In particular, we target graduate/undergraduate/high school researchers. While we welcome Writing Center directors and administrators as co-authors, the journal’s overall purpose is to forward the work of new voices in the field.Another key aspect of this publication is its multi-tiered leadership, which provides entering WC scholars with the opportunity to receive mentoring from more experienced WC researchers/editors. The editorial team includes WC professionals and graduate students who will work together on reviewing manuscripts and offering feedback to writers, who will also be mentored through the publication process.

For one, our goal is to get just about every pertinent submission to publication, and, secondly, we expect our reviewers to offer feedback that allows the author(s) to grow and develop throughout the review process. In other words, our reviewers are invited to act like writing consultants. All reviewers are invited to closely read theTPRGuidelines for Reviewers.
